# Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publication Guidelines
This document describes the steps that a publisher must follow to publish an offer to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

## Approval to Publish an Offer
As a provider of software applications or services, you must be given approval to publish to the Azure Marketplace. The approval process reviews a publisher's attainment of the business and technical requirements to be integrated into the Azure Marketplace. 
- Business Requirements: refer to the Azure Marketplace Participation Policies
- Technical requirements: refer to details for each of the integration types described below

### Where to apply
Publishers must first apply via the Request Information link on http://azure.com/certified

## Publisher Contact & Seller Registration 

### Create Microsoft Account
In order to complete the publishing process, you will need to create a Microsoft account. This account will be used to log in to both the Publishing Portal and the Seller Dashboard. You should only have one Microsoft Account for your Azure Store offerings. They should not be specific to individual VMs. 

The address that forms the user name should be on your domain and controlled by your IT team (such as azurepublishing@yourcompany.com). Payment, tax information, and reporting will be routed through this account. 

- 1.	Within your own domain, create a Distribution List (DL) or Security Group with an email address such as AzureStore@yourcompany.com
- 2.	Add your Azure VM publishing team to the DL. The DL must be live to receive the confirmation email necessary to create your account. 
- 3.	Register for a Microsoft Account using Distribution List Email using the DL email. You can register for a Microsoft Account at https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx
- 4.	When registering, use a valid phone number. The system will send a send verification code as a text message or an automated call if identity verification is required.
- 5.	Respond to the verification email sent to the Azure VM publishing DL. 

### Register in the Publishing Portal
- 1.	Go to http://publish.windowsazure.com and create an account using the Microsoft Account you created in step 1.1. 
- 2.	Read and agree to the terms of the publishing portal. 
- 3.	Click “I want to publish for the Virtual Machine Marketplace…”
- 4.	Stop here for now

### Create your Seller Dashboard account
Creating your Seller Dashboard account is a one-time task. You should check to make sure your company does not already have a Seller Dashboard account before attempting to create one. During the process, we will collect bank account information, tax information, and company address information. These are typically obtainable from finance or business contacts. For complete instructions on how to create a Seller Dashboard account, see “Create Your Account and Add Payout Information in the Microsoft Seller Dashboard” (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj552460.aspx)

- 1.	From the Publishing Portal, click the link that says “seller profile.” 
- 2.	Complete the “Help us protect your account” wizard, which will verify your identity via phone number or email address. 
- 3.	Go to Account Details. On this screen, you will enter your PERSONAL information, which is only used for identity verification. That means your name, email address, residential address, and personal phone number. This information is not shared with anyone outside of Microsoft. 
- 4.	Designate your account type as Company, NOT Individual. Click Next. 
- 5.	Fill out the Company Details. This is the marketing profile for your company. When it is complete, click Submit for approval. 
- 6.	If you want to offer apps for purchase, you also need to add payout and tax information and submit it for validation. If you are only offering free apps, then you do not need to add this information. You can add it later, but it takes some time to validate the tax information. If you know that you will offer apps for purchase, we recommend that you add and submit it as soon as possible. In order to add payout and tax information, go to Account > Payout & Tax and click Add. Enter your company’s information. You will be required to provide a Tax Identification Number and other tax information matching the country in which your business is headquartered.

You can monitor the status of your approvals via the Azure Publishing Portal.
