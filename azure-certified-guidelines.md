## Publisher to Customer Messaging
Your customers will want to know if your application or service runs on Microsoft Azure. You can tell them that your application is pre-tested and certified to work, and that you will stand behind and support this claim. Once your application is certified, you may include this information in your own marketing materials. Be sure to keep your messaging specific to applications that have been certified vs. broad, overarching statements.

- We will support this application running on Microsoft Azure.

## Explaining the Value of Microsoft Azure Certified
Your customers will want to know what value Microsoft Azure Certified provides for them. In general, your messaging should cover at least two of the following core value propositions of Microsoft Azure Certified for customers:
- Easily find, purchase, and deploy Microsoft Azure Certified applications and services from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.
- Use Microsoft Azure Certified solutions with confidence knowing they have been thoroughly vetted by Microsoft and the publisher for compatibility with Microsoft Azure.
- With Microsoft Azure Certified applications and services, you can bring your mission-critical workloads to the cloud with Microsoft Azure and the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

### Correct:
- As a Microsoft Azure Certified application, enterprise customers can easily find, purchase and deploy Contoso’s product from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and ensure technical compatibility for customers bringing their existing Contoso product licenses to run on Azure.

## Call to Action and Microsoft Azure Marketplace Messaging
The call to action for customers should be to purchase or deploy your application from the unified Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Customers will benefit by receiving clear messaging that explains where they can go to purchase or deploy your product on Azure, as linked to directly by a URL to your product’s listing in the Azure Marketplace.

### Correct: 
- Microsoft Azure Marketplace
- Azure Marketplace (only as a shortened name after the full name has been used at least once)

### Incorrect: 
- Azure Marketplace
- Azure VM Gallery

## Logo Implementation
Once you have met requirements and your application has been certified, you will receive the Microsoft Azure Certified badge. The following defines how you should use this logo to highlight that your product is Microsoft Azure Certified.

### Placement:
The Microsoft Azure Certified badge will be displayed on the Azure Marketplace page that features your application. The badge may also be placed on your own website on a page that features the application. The badge should not be placed in such a way that indicates that all other applications are certified as such. It should not be placed on a “partners” page to indicate that you are Microsoft Partner.
The badge should always link to http://azure.com/certified where customers can gather more information about the Microsoft Azure Certified program.

### Clear Space and Minimum Size:
Provide adequate clear space around the badge equal to the height of the “M” in the badge. The logo should not be used any smaller than .5”x.5”.
